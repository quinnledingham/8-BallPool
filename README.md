# 8-Ball Pool

8-Ball Pool game written in C#
![gameplay image](https://github.com/quinnledingham/8-Ball-Pool/blob/master/Images/gameplay.PNG?raw=true)

My first time implementing  
- collision detection  
- computer player to play against  
- sound playing based on what happens on screen  
  
The collision detection does not work well when dealing with high speeds.  
  
The computer player just tries to find a ball and a hole that are close enough so it can try to hit the ball towards the hole. It is not very good at the game.  
  
It plays a sound if a collision is detected. Works surprisingly well.  
  
Last worked on in 2018
